Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?
What did you do particularly well in identifying their software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a companyâ€™s overall wellbeing?

Atermis Financial is a company that handles individualized financial plans for their clients to help them save and invest money more efficiently. Security is very important for this type of client since they are handling personal and private financial information and it would be extremely detrimental if that information fell into the wrong hands. Being able to reassure clients that their information is secure is a big selling point for handling their finances because it gives them a level of comfort when sharing this information. I think I handled finding their vulnerabilities well, especially making sure that all dependencies were updated to the latest stable release to ensure all security for that dependency was up to date.  

What about the process of working through the vulnerability assessment did you find challenging or helpful?

I found working through the vulnerability assessment overall helpful, but I did find the amount of information on one page in the report to be challenging at some points to read through. I wish the different vulnerabilities were organized in a way where I could limit the amount of information being looked at, at one time. 

How did you approach the need to increase layers of security? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to assess vulnerabilities and determine mitigation techniques?

First I looked to see where vulnerabilities might be and what information could be useful to hackers and make sure that information was secure to the highest standard. Using SHA-256 encryption to encode data for the API will be helpful for this because it allows private and personal information to be transferred from the API to the client securely.  

How did you ensure the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?

Making sure the code was functional was just re-running the code to make sure we didn't receive any errors. Making sure the code was secure after refactoring, I re-ran the vulnerability report to make sure no new vulnerabilities were introduced. 

What resources, tools, or coding practices did you employ that you might find helpful in future assignments or tasks?

I think the vulnerability report is something that I will use in future projects that are in Java. Learning more about the IDE eclipse was also helpful in this class because past and I am sure future classes will use this IDE. 

Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to demonstrate your skills, knowledge, and experience. What from this particular assignment might you want to showcase to a future employer?

I would show the ability to create certificates and the ability to use the keygen tool in Java. I would also showcase the vulnerability report to show that security is important to me and it is something I often think about when creating software.
